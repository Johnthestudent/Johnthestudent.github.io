            This entire RPG game was created for entertainment and educational purposes only. The former is definitely for my acquaintances and friends so that they can play with, 
            while the latter is for me, because during the construction of this game, many things could be learnt and experienced out in the topic of web programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            The story of the game itself is a sequel of the story of <i>Subarukosz</i> and the stories of the non-commercial OC-s of my acquaintances and friends. For further information, 
            ask <b>thetraveler91</b>, <b>MarnicSteve92</b> and <b>SuperKirby2008</b> about their OC-s on <a href="https://www.deviantart.com">www.deviantart.com </a>. As for Subarukosz, you can find content about it on that site, while the major 
            literature content of it is on <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net">www.fanfiction.net</a>. It is not obligatory to know its story or the stories of the non-commercial OC-s of the forementioned people to enjoy 
            the gameplay, yet I recommend to take a look if you wish to.
        </p>
        <p>
            The level of violence in the game scarcely hits the one, which is present in well-known Flash RPG games and in subgames and mods of Minetest. Due to the fact that content of 
            the latter is regularly uploaded by programmers with ease, neither this game is exception, so no worries, no issues.
