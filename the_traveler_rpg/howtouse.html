    <p>Greetings!
        In this RPG game, you have to choose one out of the 10 heroes and complete 21 missions. 
    </p>
    <p>An RPG game is famous for that the player has to evaluate the options and select the correct ones to find the winning strategy. 
        While there are cases, where there is only one path for the winning strategy, it doesn’t mean that there can't be multiple more.
    </p>

    <p>
        Right clicking on the Start game button, you are presented the interface, where you can choose one hero. 
        Each one has higher values for one stat. Click on the right or the left arrow indicator buttons to choose another one.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is the main interface of the game. Clicking on the Save game will create a json file, which can be used for the Load game button at the character chooser interface.
        In case you want to play with another hero, click on the Back to character chooser button. The exit image doesn’t work, you have to close the tab of the game in the 
        browser.
    </p>

    <p>
        The options section will show you details and turn of two things. Style and Credits buttons show details, but the two Save buttons are the most important here. The first 
        ensures that you will be able to play with an insanely difficult bonus mission, while the other enables the helper section, the one that you are taking a look at right now.
    </p>

    <p>
        Click on the Inventory button in order to manage your inventory. 
    </p>
    <img src="Helper sources/Helperimage04.jpg">
    <p>
        Its content will change during missions. You can manage more than 2 dozen of different items. While many can be gathered via missions, some need to be bought. Items can be 
        bought with copper, silver or gold denars. Move your cursor to the image of the item to have the focus semi on it. Then the item image gets a red border and you will be 
        shown the item’s name. Clicking on the image of the item will show the sell and buy price of the item. Click on the light blue right or left square buttons to show the 
        other items.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will be warned if you have no resources to sell or no denars to buy. In addition, some items are needed to create specific items, for instance, you need an iron ingot to 
        create a bucket. Clicking on the buttons of the special items will give you warning message about what resources are needed, in case you have not enough of them.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can convert denars in a way that you will get 1 silver denar for 10 copper denars, and you will get 1 gold denar for 2 silver denars. These options will be handy occasionally.
    </p>

    <p>
        Click on the Research section to level up your skills for points. 
    </p>
    <img src="Helper sources/Helperimage05.jpg">
    <p>
        There you can see 3 categories: the first row is for the medic, the second for miner, the third for builder. Under each column you can see how many points are needed to unlock each 
        level of each skill. Be cautious, because the points stand for this section of the game and the hero stat level up as well, so you have to manage your points with great care, 
        deciding well about what values to increase for each level up.
    </p>
    <p>
        Medic level is for health point (HP) regenerating. While you can regenerate HP in RPG battles with using medical liquid, you can increase its efficiency with medic level. The higher it 
        is, the more HP you will receive for using medical liquid.
    </p>
    <p>
        Miner level is for gathering resources. The higher it is, the more you will receive from the given resource / item type, and more experience points (XP) too. To make it more interesting, 
        some uncommon / rare resources require higher level of miner. For example, you can gather copper ingot with miner level 2, but oil and moonstone require level 4.
    </p>
    <p>
        Builder level is needed for some missions. You will be shown for some castle rebuilding missions which level of builder is required. You will be able to finish those only if you have the 
        given level of builder.
    </p>
    <img src="Helper sources/Helperimageherostat.jpg">
    <p>
        Click on the Hero section to check out the hero’s stats and level. 
    </p>
    <img src="Helper sources/Helperimage06.jpg">
    <p>
        The points shown in the Research section can be used here too. Click on the plus indicator button next to a stat to increase the numeric value of it. If you have no points and then you 
        click on the button, a warning message pops up stating that you should level up your character.
    </p>
    <p>
        Health is health points (HP). The more it is, the longer the hero can withstand battle. Attack, Defense, Speed are obvious by first reading, but you will be shown in the description of 
        the RPG battle section of the game how do they work. Intelligence or IP (intelligence points) are needed to do special attacks during RPG battles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Around the top left corner can you find the hero level and an interesting numeric value. The left side is the present numeric value of experience points (XP), and the right side of it is 
        the next level indicator XP value. If you wish to level up your hero, then the left side number must be bigger than the right side one. Only then can you click on the Level up button to 
        level up your hero. Each time you level up, you are given 10 points. You may ask why not automatic it is? Well, after a great amount of time of working on it, this solution has become the 
        final version.
    </p>
    <img src="Helper sources/Helperimagemapsection.jpg">
    <p>
        Click on the map section at the top left corner of the main menu to take a look at the map of the mission. 
    </p>
    <img src="Helper sources/Helperimage07.jpg">
    <p>
        There you can see the map section related to the mission with 5 buttons, and two buttons on the top, while multiple buttons in a carousel below, alongside with a message box.
    </p>
    <img src="Helper sources/Helperimagestory.jpg">
    <p>
        Click on the story button to see the story related to the mission. Click on it again to return back to the map section. 
    </p>
    <img src="Helper sources/Helperimage08.jpg">
    <img src="Helper sources/Helperimagequests.jpg">
    <p>
        Click on the Quests button to see the mission description and victory conditions of it. Return to the map section by clicking on it again.
    </p>
    <img src="Helper sources/Helperimage09.jpg">
    <p>
        The Forward button takes you to the next mission, but having all the victory conditions of the recent mission true is a must before going further. With the Backward button, you can go back 
        to the map section of the finished mission, but only for resource gathering.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each Gather resources button has its own characteristic, based on the map section and the mission. By clicking on them, the message box will show you what resource / item did you receive, 
        and on the above section of showing your XP, you will see how many XP did you receive. The level up possible line in the below message box is an additional one, in case it doesn’t get 
        updated, even if your current XP is higher than the level limit XP, then just use the F5 key on your keyboard to refresh it.
    </p>
    <p>
        While for some cases if you click on these buttons, you may possibly get into an RPG battle, the main battle section is the Battle button. Click on it to start an RPG battle related to the mission.
    </p>
    <img src="Helper sources/Helperimage10.jpg">
    <p>
        The last button on the map has its name related to the mission. Clicking on it will you see the victory conditions in the message box. There you can see the indicator of the defeated opponents and 
        the resources needed indicators. In order to give in resources for the mission from your inventory, click on one of the mini buttons (for example Add wood).
    </p>
    <img src="Helper sources/Helperimagebattle.jpg">
    <p>
        If you click on the Battle button, you will see the most exciting part of the game, the battle section of the entire game. Each mission has its own one, with a default opponent. Some have friendly duels, 
        where the supporter characters are challenging the hero, while the rest of the opponents in the battle section are hostile. 
    </p>
    <img src="Helper sources/Helperimage11.jpg">
    <p>
        On that section of the game, you can see the hero character on the left, alongside with the hero stats, while the opponent and opponent stats on the right. The tiny squire shows the base weapon of the hero, 
        while the opponent move rectangle will show the name of the opponent’s attack type.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the explanation of the logic of the RPG fight, let’s do this math:
    </p>
    <p>
        Let your chosen hero character be called A, while the opponent character be B. Both of them have health, attack, defense, speed, intelligence values. If we speak about the health points (HP) value of hero 
        character, we refer to it like A.health. Victory condition is this: if B.health <= 0. If A.health <=0, then the battle is lost and has to be retaken. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As for the attack, defense, speed stats, here it is how they work: 
    </p>
    <p>
        if A.attack > B.defense -> then A.attack + (the difference between A.attack and B.defense) <br>
        else: A.attack - (the difference between A.attack and B.defense)<br>
        <br>if A.speed > B.speed -> then.A attack + (the difference between A.speed and B.speed) <br>
        else: A.attack - (the difference between A.speed and B.speed)
    </p>
    <p>
        Now for the intelligence! It is needed for the special attack types. The special attack types are located in the second row. If you click one, it will decrease A.intelligence, B.health, and depending on 
        the chosen special attack, either B.defense or B.speed. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The regular attack types are the first row’s buttons. Each one’s strength is different, and they get greater as the player levels up the hero. Be aware, because the opponents in the friendly duel do not 
        randomize their attacks, like how the hostile opponents do (except for the Smasher) for all the hero’s attacks, whether regular or special! Therefore, if you are in a friendly duel and you choose the 
        biggest attack value based attack, then the same will the opponent character do.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recover button is for regenerating HP (health points). Clicking on it decreases the number of medical liquid in your inventory and increases A.health. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Card attacks are special tools, made by the supporters of the chosen hero, those can be used in the fight. They function in the same way like the special attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Last but not least, here is the list of the names of regular and special attacks of the heroes, and what the attacks do:
