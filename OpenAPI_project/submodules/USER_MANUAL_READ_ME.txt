The submodules folder contains 15 folders, each of which has code for specific mini tasks to be implemented.

These are for experimental purposes, also were actually test codes, before implementing the big server.

They can be tried out in the following way:

1.) Download the entire project folder into C:/xampp/htdocs folder. In case you don't have xampp, please, install it!

2.) Start xampp with double clicking on xampp-control file.

3.) Start the Apache and the MySQL servers. In case you are about to try out the databaseconstructor or the databasehandler modules, go to Task manager/Services, and start running
MySQL80 service! Also, don't forget to add your username and password into the php code, otherwise the connection to the database will fail!

4.) Type in your browser: localhost/downloaded_project_name/submodules/name_of_the_module.

5.) In case you try out the modules made for constructing a downloadable json or xml file, note that you can save them to anywhere you want.
